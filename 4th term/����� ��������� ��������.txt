LONDON, May 16, 2012 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Smart buildings are the future of building technologies. New innovations are geared towards making buildings greener and more "intelligent". One of the leading platforms of implementing smart technology in buildings is through automation systems.

On this subject Frost & Sullivan is hosting a complimentary analyst briefing with Senior Research Analyst Neetha Jayanth. The web conference will take place on 24th May at 3:00 p.m. BST.

This briefing will analyze the growth prospects of building automation systems in Europe and how this is expected to further the development of smart buildings. In particular, it will provide:

An overview of key Mega Trends that will impact the development of Smart Buildings over this decade

An analysis of revenue growth estimates for building automation in Europe

An integrated industry perceptive of competitive trends

Ms Jayanth explains: "Though there has been a slump in the building technologies industry across Europe in recent times, the growth prospects of energy efficient and smart systems remain high. In fact, consumers are expected to focus on reducing operational expenses in buildings as they recover from this economic crisis."
